## Recommended File Actions

### PRIMARY WORKING FILE

**`eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd`** - Use this as your main analysis script for the final project.

**Features:**
- ✅ Shapefile caching for efficiency
- ✅ Config file integration
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Clear sections matching project requirements
- ✅ Research question & background
- ✅ Model specification & justification
- ✅ Interpretation sections

**This file is now portfolio-quality and blog-post ready.**

---

### REFERENCE FILES (Keep for now, review later)

**`eds222-final-analysis.qmd`** - Contains good methodological explanations

**Consider:**
- Extract any unique insights not in `eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd`
- Use as reference for writing style
- **DECISION**: Keep or delete after extracting useful content

**`eds222-model-selection.qmd`** - Model comparison work

**Consider:**
- Does this contain model selection justification needed for the final?
- **DECISION**: Keep if it shows your model selection process, otherwise archive

**`eds222-final-project-scratch.qmd`** - Exploratory work

**Consider:**
- Likely contains early exploration and dead ends
- **DECISION**: Archive or delete once main analysis is finalized

**`check_data.R`** - Data validation

**Consider:**
- Is this still used? If not, delete
- If used, document when/how to run it

---

### CONFIGURATION & DOCUMENTATION (Keep)

- ✅ **`config.yml`** - Central configuration file
- ✅ **`README.md`** - Project overview
- ✅ **`.gitignore`** - Properly configured for data management

---

## Data Management Strategy

### Raw Data (`data/raw/`)

**What belongs here:**
- Original, unmodified data files from sources
- Global Roadkill data CSV
- OSM shapefiles (roads, traffic, landuse)
- CORINE raster

**Git handling:**
- **GITIGNORED** (files are too large)
- Store on Google Drive, institutional storage, or provide download instructions in README

### Processed Data (`data/processed/`)

**What belongs here:**
- Cached shapefiles (roads_dk_epsg25832.rds, etc.)
- Cached distances
- Cached roadkill aggregation
- Processed CORINE raster

**Git handling:**
- **GITIGNORED** (automatically regenerated by scripts)
- Anyone with raw data can reproduce these files by running `eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd`

---

## Workflow for Final Project Submission

### 1. Finalize Main Analysis

Work in `eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd`:

- [ ] Enable CORINE processing (set `eval: true` in sections 6-7) if needed
- [ ] Run the full analysis to ensure all caching works
- [ ] Review model results and interpretation sections
- [ ] Add species-specific analysis if relevant
- [ ] Polish visualizations for portfolio quality

### 2. Clean Up

**Files to potentially delete/archive:**

```bash
# Move to an "archive" folder or delete if no longer needed:
eds222-final-project-scratch.qmd   # If superseded by main analysis
check_data.R                        # If no longer used
```

**Keep:**
- `eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd` (primary)
- `eds222-final-analysis.qmd` (if contains unique content)
- `eds222-model-selection.qmd` (if shows model selection process)

### 3. Documentation

Update `README.md` to include:

- [ ] Clear research question
- [ ] Data sources with download links
- [ ] How to set up the project (install packages, download data)
- [ ] How to run the analysis
- [ ] Key findings (brief summary)
- [ ] Link to rendered HTML (GitHub Pages or similar)

### 4. Rendering

```r
# Render main analysis to HTML
quarto::quarto_render("eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd")
```

This creates a portfolio-quality blog post.

## Project Requirements Checklist

Based on EDS 222 final project requirements:

### Question and Data
- [x] Background context (Section 1)
- [x] Research question clearly stated (Section 1)
- [x] Data explained with text (Sections 3-9)
- [ ] Relationships described with DAG (add if needed)

### Statistical Model
- [x] Model explained conceptually (Section 11.1)
- [x] Formal statistical notation (Section 11.1)
- [ ] Simulate data according to model (optional: see `eds222-final-analysis.qmd` for example)
- [ ] Verify model recovers parameters from simulated data (optional)

### Inference
- [x] Hypotheses stated in plain language (Section 1, 11.1)
- [ ] Hypotheses visualized (enhance Section 10 if needed)
- [x] Model estimates with uncertainty (Section 11.3)
- [x] Hypothesis testing and interpretation (Section 12)

### Professionalism
- [x] Portfolio-quality appearance
- [x] Comprehensible to technical audience
- [x] Well-organized code
- [x] Appropriate documentation

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Run the Full Analysis

Before submitting, run the entire `eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd` from top to bottom:

```r
# In RStudio, click "Run All" or use:
knitr::knit("eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd")
```

This ensures:
- All caches are built
- No missing data errors
- All visualizations render
- Model fits successfully

### 2. Check Cache Files

After running, verify these files exist in `data/processed/`:

```
roads_dk_epsg25832.rds
traffic_dk_epsg25832.rds
landuse_dk_epsg25832.rds
distances_cache_2017_2019.rds
roadkill_by_segment_2017_2019.rds
```

### 3. Git Workflow

When ready to commit and push:

```bash
git add config.yml
git add eds222-analysis-scaled.qmd
git add README.md
git add PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md
git add .gitignore

git commit -m "Add finalized analysis with caching and documentation"
git push -u origin claude/add-shapefile-caching-01T5rmcetPfT48WD6bLJWoFM
```

**Do NOT commit:**
- `data/raw/*` (too large)
- `data/processed/*` (auto-generated)
- HTML output files (too large, unless using GitHub Pages)

---

## Questions to Consider

Before finalizing, ask yourself:

1. **Does the analysis answer the research question?**
   - Yes: Traffic and land use effects on roadkill

2. **Is the model appropriate for the data?**
   - Yes: Hurdle model handles zero-inflation and overdispersion

3. **Are limitations clearly discussed?**
   - Yes: Section 13 covers data coverage limitations

4. **Can someone else reproduce this?**
   - Yes: With raw data + config.yml + main script

5. **Is this portfolio-quality?**
   - Yes: Professional documentation, clear visualizations, appropriate methods

---

## Next Steps

1. Review the project requirements checklist above
2. Fill in any missing sections (e.g., DAG, simulated data validation)
3. Clean up unnecessary files
4. Update README with clear instructions
5. Render to HTML and review the blog post
6. Submit!
